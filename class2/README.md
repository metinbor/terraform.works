Configure route tables properly. Once private and public subnet created, please create ec2 instance (manually)  on public subnet and ping google.com. If everything is successful, you should have proper response

Moving forward, on that VPC you just provisioned, please create ec2 intance to install jenkins. Jenkins has to be installed using terraform provisioner.
